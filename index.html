        <p>My favourite hobbies are car racing and football. Football is a team sport, in which you can score only by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Teams content 11 players â€“ field players and a goalkeeper. Goalkeeper is the only person that can touch the ball with his hands, but only in his penalty area. If speed is your medicine, then auto racing is the perfect hobby for you. Many think of auto racing as just getting behind the wheel of a fast car and going around laps, racing your opponents until that chequered flag is waved and someone ends up winning. In essence, that would be correct, but it's far from accurate. </p>
